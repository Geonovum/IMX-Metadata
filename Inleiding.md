## Introduction

Kadaster and Geonovum are developing a mechanism to facilitate the semantic integration of decentralized data registers. A central API operates on an integrated semantic layer. The semantic layer constitutes of a coherent information model integrating several domain specific domain models. An API orchestration layer directs data communication to and from existing data registries.

Data retrieval is according to the information model of the semantic layer. Data retrieval will optionally include metadata about the lineage (provenance) of each singular piece of information about a resource.

This document describes a proposed standard for describing data elements.

### Target audience

Information modeller, API developer, IT architect.

### Introduction to document


Chapter 2 - [Vocabulary](#vocabulary) introduces a conceptual model for data elements. Since this model describes how data van be described it is considered a metadatamodel.

Chapter 3 - [Metadata MIM extension](#metadata-mim-extension) we will apply thhis vocabulary and introduce an extention to MIM that allows to connect a modelelement in an information model to a modelelement in a metadatamodel.
